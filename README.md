java-multithread-downloader
===========================

### What?

Java-multithread-downloader is a java download library which supports multithread.

### How?

```java

//Step0: we need a download manager

DownloadManager downloadManager = DownloadManager.getInstance(); 

//Step1: we need construct a mission

String qqApp = "http://dldir1.qq.com/qqfile/qq/QQ2013/QQ2013Beta2.exe";
String saveDirectory = "";
String newName = "qqApp.exe"

DownloadMission mission = new DownloadMission(qQString,saveDirectory, newName);

//Step2: deliver this mission to manager

downloadManager.addMission(mission);

//Step3: Let's start

downloadManager.start();

```

### I'm sure, it's convinient

There are some useful method you can use:

```java

mission.getReadableSize() //get mission target file size (which is readable end with KB/MB/GB…)

mission.getReadableSpeed() //get mission's readable downloading speed

mission.getReadableAverageSpeed() //get avarage download speed

mission.getReadableMaxSpeed() //get max download speed
 
mission.getActiveTheadCount() // get mission's downloading thread count

mission.isFinished() //judge if a mission is finished

mission.getTimePassed() //get download time

mission.pause() //pause this mission ,and it will automatically resume when you start again. 

```
